# Full onboarding from scratch on stock Google APIs API 34.
# clearState revokes all runtime permissions, so every permission page appears.
# Page order: WELCOME -> MICROPHONE -> NOTIFICATIONS -> BLUETOOTH -> LOCATION -> ASSISTANT -> COMPLETE
#
# After granting a permission, refreshPages() removes that page from the
# ViewPager and the next page auto-appears at the same index.
